# Get deployment info

A GitHub action that gets the information needed to build and deploy an Octue service to the cloud. This information is
extracted and/or generated from:

- The action inputs
- `git`
- `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`

## Usage

Add the action as a step in your workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Install poetry
    uses: snok/install-poetry@v1.3.3

  - name: Get deployment info
    id: get-deployment-info
    uses: octue/get-deployment-info@0.2.1
    with:
      gcp_project_name: test-project
      gcp_project_number: 1234
      gcp_region: europe-west1
      gcp_resource_affix: test
      gcp_service_name: my-test-service
      gcp_environment: main
```

Outputs can be accessed in the usual way. For example, to print all the outputs:

```yaml
- name: Print outputs
  run: |
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.branch_tag_kebab }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.branch_tag_screaming }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.image_latest_artifact }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.image_latest_tag }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.image_version_artifact }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.image_version_tag }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.short_sha }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.version_slug }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_environment }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_project_name }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_project_number }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_region }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_resource_affix }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.gcp_service_name }}
    echo ${{ steps.get-deployment-info.outputs.version }}
```

Note: there's no need to print the outputs for debugging in practice - the action prints them to `stdout` for this very
purpose.
